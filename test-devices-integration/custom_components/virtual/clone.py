"""
Full-fidelity device cloning — PistonCore addition to hass-virtual (FORK_NOTES.md).

Service: virtual.clone_device
  device_id:   (required) the REAL device to copy. An entity_id is also accepted,
               for entities that have no device-registry entry of their own.
  group_name:  (optional) which virtual group to create it in; omit if only one.
  device_name: (optional) what to call the copy; defaults to "Test — <original>".

WHY THIS LIVES HERE AND NOT IN THE CALLER (VIRTUAL_DEVICES_SPEC §5.7a).
The platforms in this integration validate against CLOSED schemas: hand one a
config key it does not declare and entity creation fails outright. So the list of
attributes a clone copies and the schemas that accept them are a single contract.
Keeping them in one place makes it impossible for them to disagree. When the
capture list lived in PistonCore, every schema change here needed a matching
change in another project on another release cycle — guaranteed drift.

WHERE THE CAPTURE LIST COMES FROM — read this before adding to it.
Every entry is taken from HOME ASSISTANT's own `capability_attributes` property on
the matching entity base class, which is HA's definition of "the attributes that
describe what this entity can DO". It must NOT be derived by looking at whatever
devices happen to be on one install: an earlier pass did exactly that and silently
dropped `target_humidity_step` and `swing_horizontal_modes`, because the install it
was written against had no device reporting them.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COPY — this is a privacy boundary, not an omission.
Bridged devices carry driver-level extras beyond anything HA defines, and some are
secrets: a Hubitat-bridged alarm panel exposes `codes` containing plaintext PINs
with the names they belong to, and locks expose household member names via `codes`
and `last_code_name`. Sticking to HA's capability attributes keeps all of it out.
A clone is meant to be shareable in a bug report; widening this list past HA's
capability attributes would publish somebody's alarm code.

KNOWN LIMIT: this clones SHAPE, not BEHAVIOUR. It reproduces what a device says it
can do; it does not reproduce how that device's own integration mangles values in
flight. Capability bugs are catchable on a clone, integration-behaviour bugs are not.
