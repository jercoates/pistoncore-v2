"""
PistonCore addition to hass-virtual: HA-native services to create and remove a
virtual (test) DEVICE live, without hand-editing the group's yaml file.

This is an ADDITIVE PistonCore layer (see FORK_NOTES.md). It reuses the base
integration's own file helpers and reload path: it edits the group's yaml file
and reloads the config entry, which async_setup_entry already handles as
"create new devices + delete orphaned ones". Kept in its own module (with only a
tiny hook in __init__.py) so pulling upstream fixes stays easy.

Standalone self-sufficiency (VIRTUAL_DEVICES_SPEC.md §5.6): both services are
plain HA services, so a user WITHOUT PistonCore can call them from
Developer Tools -> Actions. PistonCore's control panel calls the same services.

Service: virtual.create_device
  group_name:  (optional) which virtual group's file to write; omit if only one.
  device_name: (required) the device this becomes — its entities are grouped
               under one device-registry entry (the "one device, many
               capabilities" shape).
  entities:    (required) list of entity dicts, each with a 'platform' key plus
               that platform's normal virtual options (name, class, initial_value,
               unit_of_measurement, ...). Same shape as a device block in
               virtual.yaml.

Service: virtual.remove_device
  group_name:  (optional) as above.
  device_name: (required) the device to remove. Its entities are removed and the
               device is deleted from the registry on reload (no orphans).

    Both services are read-modify-write on a single yaml file followed by a

    before ANY caller saved it, so all but the last were silently erased: the
    service returned success and the device simply never appeared. Measured on
    a clean HA 2026-07-31 — six concurrent creates produced one device and no
    error of any kind. PistonCore's clone panel hits this the moment it creates
    more than one device, and so would any standalone UI.

    Two guarantees here:
      * the load/change/save runs under a per-entry lock, so no change is lost;
      * a burst of changes triggers ONE reload at the end, not one each —
        whoever finds no one else waiting does it. Reloading per call is what
